# HighPerfomance
My personal learning experience in high performance computing

Welcome!

As a student and researcher in wall turbulence and computational
fluid dynamics, I have three tasks:
1. Transform the physics, Navier Stokes(NS) equations precisely,
   to a problem that can be computed by the computer.
2. Write codes to solve the problem mentioned in 1.
3. Analyze the data, like the velocity field, obtained by 2

Most work relies heavy on

Numerical method:
1. How to solve a linear equation Ax = b
2. Perform common calculus operations like integral and
   differentiation numerically

All numerical methods are combined to solve the NS equation
